#Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. They seem to be commonly abbreviated to 'PR'.
When you open a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.

Typically you'll make a pull request by opening a new branch, editing stuff there, and committing changes to that branch. Then that branch will be ready to merged into the master branch, so the pull request can be created.
